* Download this [zip file](https://github.com/dekuNukem/duckypad/raw/master/japan_test.zip), copy everything inside to the **root** of SD card

* Eject the card and put it back in duckyPad

## Try it out

* **Make sure your system is in Japanese input mode**

* Try the sample profiles and see if everything works

* Especially **Profile 4: Japan**

* Try the top six input mode keys and see if they work

* Open a text editor, and try the bottom 3 keys.

* It will type out some texts and symbols

* The `letter` and `symb` key output should look EXACTLY like below. Let me know if it doesn't.
