# Purchasing a duckyPad

[Main Page](/README.md)

------

Thanks for considering supporting this project!

I was actually planning a kickstarter earlier this year, but with the coronavirus situation, launching a campaign right now doesn't seem to be the best timing.

Still, I do have **around 30 duckyPads in stock** from a test production run, and you can purchase one directly from me.

Those circuit boards are professionally machine-assembled by a PCB fab house, and are fully tested.
