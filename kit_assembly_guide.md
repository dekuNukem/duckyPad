Thanks for getting duckyPad!

Here's how to put everything together.

## Tools

A small **Phillips-head screwdriver** (`+`shape) should be provided in the package.

A socket bit or **pair of pliers** also helps, but not required.

## Assembly Steps

You should have the following items:

And the following fasteners:

* 6x `8mm Screw`

* 8x `2.8mm Screw`

* 7x `3mm Spacer`

* 6x `4mm Spacer`

Pay special attention to the **brass spacers**!

* One is **slightly shorter** than the other.

* Separate them out before starting, don't mix them up!

Start by peeling off the protective cover on the front and back plate:

Place the `Back Plate` in front of you like this. Note the orientation of the holes:

Start from a hole in the middle, put a `8mm Screw` through the back side:

Then screw on the `3mm Spacers`.

Don't over-tighten! Doing so might deform or crack the acrylic plate.

Finger-tight is OK, just make sure it's not loose and doesn't rattle.

Do the same with all the holes **`EXCEPT the bottom right`**:

Put a `2.8mm Screw` through that one:

And install the `3mm Spacers`.

**Wash your hands** to discharge static electricity.

Grab the circuit board by its edge, line up and install as shown:

Then install all six `4mm Spacers`, moderately tighten.

Also install the `2.8mm Screw` on the lower right.

Line up the `Front Plate`, and install the `2.8mm Screws`.

**`DO NOT`** tighten each screw as you install it! Put them all on loosely first, then tighten them one-by-one.

This ensures the plate is properly lined up. Again, don't over-tighten.

Flip it over, clean the plate with a dry cloth if dirty, and stick on the anti-slip pads on each corner:

Time to install the switches! duckyPad supports hot-swap, so no soldering is needed. 

* **Make sure the pins are straight!**

* **Make sure the pins are straight!** 

* **Make sure the pins are straight!**, otherwise you might damage the circuit board or the switch itself!

Then **line up with the holes**, and **`gently push straight down`** until it clicks in place:

Keycaps next! Note the orientation ("slope" side pointing left in this photo). Just push it down.

![Alt text](resources/pics/assembly/assembly15.jpeg)

All the keys should be lined up evenly. If not, try push down or wiggle it a little.

Finally, if it hasn't already been done, peel off the protective cover on the OLED screen:

And you're done! Congratulations!
