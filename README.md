# duckyPad: Do-it-all Mechanical Macropad

![Alt text](resources/pics/title.jpg)

duckyPad is a 15-key mechanical macro keypad with RGB backlight and OLED screen.

When pressed, each key executes a user-defined script from an SD card. 

The scripts can be as simple as shortcuts like `ctrl+c`, or as complex as [creating root backdoors](https://github.com/hak5darren/USB-Rubber-Ducky/wiki/Payload---OSX-Root-Backdoor) or [grabbing passwords](https://github.com/hak5darren/USB-Rubber-Ducky/wiki/Payload---download-mimikatz%2C-grab-passwords-and-email-them-via-gmail). All customizable by you.

duckyPad offers limitless possibilities to consolidate and customise your workflows.
