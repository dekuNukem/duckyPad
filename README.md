# duckypad: Scriptable Mechanical Keypad with RGB Backlight

![Alt text](resources/pics/title.jpg)

duckypad is a mechanical keypad with RGB backlight, OLED screen, and 15 keys. Each key can execute a script when pressed.

The scripts can be as simple as shortcuts like `ctrl+c`, or as complex as [creating root backdoors](https://github.com/hak5darren/USB-Rubber-Ducky/wiki/Payload---OSX-Root-Backdoor) or [grabbing passwords](https://github.com/hak5darren/USB-Rubber-Ducky/wiki/Payload---download-mimikatz%2C-grab-passwords-and-email-them-via-gmail). It's all customizable by you.

Multiple profiles are supported, for different programs/environments.

## Features

* 15 mechanical switches
* Individually addressable RGB backlights with animations
